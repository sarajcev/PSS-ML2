**Dataset**

Dataset is deposited on zenodo: [Power System Transient Stability Assessment Simulations Dataset - IEEE New England 39-bus test case](https://www.zenodo.org/record/4521886) DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.4521886

Dataset contains phasor measurements (PMU) signals from the **IEEE New England 39-bus power system test case** network, which are generated from a large corpus of systematic MATLABÂ®/Simulink electro-mechanical transients simulations. Different load and generation levels of the New England 39-bus benchmark power system are systematically covered, as well as all three major types of short-circuit events. Dataset contains time-domain signals from 9360 different simulations.

Undercomplete denoising stacked autoencoder for the unsupervised dimensionality reduction of the features space. A deep neural network classifier from the pretrained autoencoder (with transfer learning from the encoder). A soft voting ensemble built from a support vector machine and a random forest classifiers. Ensemble weights obtained from solving a constrained optimization problem. Hyperparameters fine-tuning using a randomized search and the Bayesian optimization. Classifier calibration with precision-recall curves, receiver operating characteristic and detection error trade-off curves. Metrics include ROC-AUC score, F1 measure, Matthews correlation coefficient and Brier score.
